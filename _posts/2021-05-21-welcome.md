I am a mathematician at the end of my first postdoc. My mathematical background is quite varied but I would consider myself mostly from the dynamical systems branch. 

I saw a couple of mathematicians maintaining blogs with interesting proofs and ideas. I didn't want to be at the consumer side of things all the time so I started a blog as well. As I will be joining an analysis group I think most of the topics will be related to refreshing my functional analysis and PDE theory. But that is just my expectation and not a prediction.  

This webpage is based on the [jekyll-Text-theme](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme). If you know basic html and read the docs you should be able to run your own blog by simpling editing the code a bit. It allows for Latex via mathjax making it convenient for math-blogging. Basic blogging functionalities have also been implemented. Jekyll can be hosted via github pages so no fees for hosting or services.
